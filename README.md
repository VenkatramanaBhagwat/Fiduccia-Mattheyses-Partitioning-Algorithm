# Fiduccia_Mattheyses_Partitioning_Algorithm
 To implement, and experiment the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning algorithm implemented for gate-level
 designs. The goal of the partitioning project is to minimize the cut set size, while meeting given area
 constraints fixed for the partitions

C++ is used for implementation.
Pearl script is used to read and modify the benchmark files to extract the required data.

1. cell.h - Contains a cell class defined. 
2. main.cpp – algorithm implemented. 
3. conv.pl – pearl file to convert .net file to .hgr
